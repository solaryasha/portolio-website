        I started my journey in programming in 2019, when I tried Harward CS 50 course. I was fascinated by the world of technology and wanted to learn more about it. I started with the basics of programming and gradually moved on to more advanced topics. I was particularly interested in web development and decided to focus on that area.

        I enrolled in a 4 month full-stack JavaScript program at Mate Academy, where I learned the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks.
        When I graduated, I got a job as a full-stack developer at Mate Academy, where I worked on various projects and gained valuable experience. I also had the opportunity to mentor students, which helped me solidify my knowledge and improve my communication skills.

        I am constantly learning and improving my skills, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me next.
